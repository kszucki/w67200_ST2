Hi, I'm Kacper
I have been working on this project for some time.
Short description of the program:
CRUD Web application used to maintain a customer database.
The admin can create a new user, then add him an insurance policy and add file attachments to it. It is also possible to filter all records in dynamic mode without pressing "search".
Another function is, for example, sorting according to the insurance end date.
The application also has a login system. The application is not very extensive, but it is still being worked on and has great scalability potential. In the future, I plan to add auth0 authorization or sending emails reminding about the expiring contract.

Technologies used:
Java
Spring-boot
Spring Security
RestAPI
Hibernate
Thymeleaf
Maven
Docker
MySQL
H2 Database
Spring Security 
JavaScript
HTML
BootStrap
